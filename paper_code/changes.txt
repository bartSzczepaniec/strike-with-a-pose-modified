Changes made by Bart≈Çomiej Szczepaniec

Updated requirements and renderer so it is possible to use the newest CUDA version and Python 3.9.2

Added files generate_dataset.py and generate_smaller_dataset_from_v2.py were used to generate my custom dataset based on the 3D models from ./3dmodels directory.
